A legal chatbot that provides answers to legal questions based on news articles, blog posts, and the Constitution of India. It uses NLP to analyze user queries, retrieves relevant legal provisions, and offers context-aware responses.

It can assist with constitutional rights, case laws, and legal procedures but does not provide official legal advice.
